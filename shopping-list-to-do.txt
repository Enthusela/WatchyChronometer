- Replace showBuzz with showShoppingList in handleButtonPress
- Write showShoppingList
    - sets guiState to SHOPLIST_STATE
    - Don't use the showTime method of looping to keep the chip awake: use the menu method of waking on press
        - This is so I can leave the watch on the list for long periods while shopping without running down the battery 
    - Modified version of showMenu
    - How do I do screen rollover?
        - var list length: needs to be determined on load so we can find end of list and display empty menu items
        - const max items on screen: defined as MENU_LENGTH
        - arg list index
        - arg list stt index
        - pass index into function
        - always display listItems[sttIndex:sttIndex+MENU_LENGTH-1]
        - update highlighted menu item as per index
        - if index is inside current range, use showFastMenu to update selection 
        - if index is outside current range, use showMenu to update displayed items and selection
        - If enter button is pressed, toggle the checked state
            - if guiState == SHOPLIST_STATE toggleItem(listindex)
            - Also draw line to strikethrough the menu item cause that sounds nice
    - char-ptr array containing list item strings (qty and name)
    - Images: checked and unchecked checkbox
    - Offset list items by checkbox width
- Consider adding shopping list to upper-right (down) button
